# Kiepskie TV

Inspired by Polish popular sitcom "Świat Według Kiepskich", you can put any your own video into legendary "Okił" finctional brand television, and watch Arnold Boczek react to it.

**100% offline** - all processing is done on edge, thanks to FFmpeg-wasm (excluding hosting and necessary static assets, of course.).

Here's an example output of what you can expect, when using your video. For this example I used well-known movie [Big Buck Bunny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Buck_Bunny).




Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project


```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
